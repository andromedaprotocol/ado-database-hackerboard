## Additional Sections/Material Needed 

Make sure you have the following in your Repo:

1. Clear and neat ReadMe file that includes a summary of the ADO and documentation on how to use it
2. ADO should contain unit tests. Testing should cover both positive and negative testing with 90% coverage. Any additional testing (on-chain or other) is also encouraged but not required.
3. ADO should contain an updated schema file ([Schema generation crate](https://crates.io/crates/cosmwasm-schema))

## Usage Guide

Provide a full exmample of the ADO usage. Include the messages called and the JSON used to call these messages.
